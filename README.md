# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Purpose:
Per upper management at AutosRUs’ an analysis of their newest prototype, the MechaCar, has been requested. The data analytics team will review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.  A review of the production data will be done for insights that may help the manufacturing team, in hopes of helping  to resolve production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. 
## Results:
The following will be done to help determine how MechaCar compares to its competition.
•	Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
•	Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
•	Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
•	Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
